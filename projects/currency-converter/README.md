## API Information
- **Provider**: ExchangeRate-API
- **Free Tier**: 1,500 requests per month

## Fallback Mode
If the API key is not configured, the application uses hardcoded exchange rates for demonstration purposes. These rates are examples and may not reflect current market rates.

## Security Considerations
- API keys should be kept secure and not shared publicly
- Consider using environment variables for API keys in production
- The application only makes read requests to the API

## Customization
You can extend the application by:
- Adding historical exchange rate data
- Implementing currency conversion charts
- Adding support for cryptocurrency conversions
- Creating a graphical user interface
- Adding currency rate alerts

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you have an active internet connection for real-time rates
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- Check the ExchangeRate-API status if rates aren't updating

## Note
Exchange rates are provided by third-party APIs and may have usage limitations. For production use, consider using a paid API plan or implementing rate limiting.
