## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

## File Structure
- `main.py` - Main application code
- `recipes.json` - Data storage file (created automatically)

## Data Format
Recipes are stored in JSON format with the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Recipe Name",
    "ingredients": ["ingredient1", "ingredient2"],
    "instructions": "Step-by-step instructions",
    "category": "Category Name"
  }
]
```

## Customization
You can extend the application by:
- Adding recipe ratings and reviews
- Implementing meal planning features
- Adding nutritional information
- Including cooking time and difficulty level
- Implementing a web interface
- Adding image support for recipes

## Security Considerations
- This application stores data locally in JSON format
- No sensitive data is handled by default
- For personal recipe collections only

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you have write permissions for the current directory
- Check that the JSON file is not corrupted if issues occur
- Verify that all required fields are provided when adding recipes

## Note
This project is intended for educational purposes and personal use. It can be expanded with additional features for more comprehensive recipe management.
