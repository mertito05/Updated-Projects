# Data Processor

A Rust application for processing and analyzing data with various statistical operations.

## Features

- Basic statistical calculations (sum, average, max, min)
- Word frequency counting
- File I/O operations (reading and writing CSV data)
- Data analysis utilities

## Usage

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the processor
cargo run

# The program will:
# 1. Calculate statistics on sample data
# 2. Count word frequencies in sample text
# 3. Write sample CSV data to a file
# 4. Read and display the CSV data
```
