# Chatbot using Basic AI

A simple rule-based chatbot implemented in C that uses pattern matching to respond to user inputs.

## Features

- Basic pattern matching for user inputs
- Predefined responses based on keywords
- Simple conversation flow
- Exit command to quit the chat

## Usage

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o chatbot
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./chatbot
   ```

3. Type your messages and the chatbot will respond based on pattern matching.

## How it Works

The chatbot uses simple string matching to identify keywords in user input and provides predefined responses. It's a basic implementation that demonstrates the concept of pattern-based AI.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques
- Add learning capabilities
- Support for more complex conversations
- File-based knowledge storage
