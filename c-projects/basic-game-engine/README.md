# Basic Game Engine

A simple console-based game engine implemented in C that provides basic game development functionality.

## Features

- Simple game loop implementation
- Basic entity management
- Collision detection
- Input handling
- Simple rendering system

## Usage

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o game_engine
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./game_engine
   ```

## Architecture

The game engine includes:
- Game loop with fixed time steps
- Entity component system
- Simple physics simulation
- Basic collision detection
- Input management
