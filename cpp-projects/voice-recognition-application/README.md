# Voice Recognition Application

A C++ voice recognition application that demonstrates basic speech-to-text functionality.

## Features

- Audio recording and playback
- Basic voice command recognition
- Simple speech-to-text conversion
- Voice activity detection
- Audio signal processing

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- Audio recording capabilities (microphone)
- Basic signal processing libraries

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Audio Capture**
   - Record audio from microphone
   - Handle different sample rates and formats
   - Buffer management

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Pre-emphasis filtering
   - Framing and windowing
   - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
   - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)

3. **Voice Activity Detection**
   - Energy-based detection
   - Zero-crossing rate analysis
   - Silence removal

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Template matching
   - Dynamic time warping
   - Simple command recognition

## Usage

```bash
# Compile the project
g++ main.cpp -o voice_recognition -std=c++11

# Run the application
./voice_recognition
```

## Example Commands

The application can recognize simple voice commands like:
- "start"
- "stop" 
- "left"
- "right"
- "up"
- "down"

## Audio Processing Pipeline

1. Record audio input
2. Pre-process (filter, normalize)
3. Detect voice activity
4. Extract features (MFCC, spectral features)
5. Match against known patterns
6. Output recognized command

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with speech recognition APIs
- Support for multiple languages
- Real-time processing
- Neural network-based recognition
- Voice authentication
- Text-to-speech synthesis
- Noise cancellation
- Multi-microphone support

## Limitations

This is a basic implementation and may not work well in noisy environments or with complex speech patterns. For production use, consider using established speech recognition libraries like:
- CMU Sphinx
- Kaldi
- Mozilla DeepSpeech
- Google Speech API
