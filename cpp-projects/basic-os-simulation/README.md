# Basic Operating System Simulation

A simple simulation of an operating system in C++ that demonstrates basic OS concepts such as process management, scheduling, and memory management.

## Features

- Process creation and termination
- Simple round-robin scheduling
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Basic file system simulation

## Usage

1. Compile the simulation:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o os_simulation
   ```

2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   ./os_simulation
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement different scheduling algorithms (e.g., FIFO, SJF)
- Add support for multi-threading
- Implement a more complex file system
- Add user interface for interaction
